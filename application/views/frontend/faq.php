                     <h6>What is Payment Gateway?</h5>
                         <p>
                             A payment gateway is an ecommerce service that processes online payments for online as well as offline businesses. Payment gateways help accept payments by transferring key information from their merchant websites to issuing banks, card associations and online wallet players.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                             Payment gateways play a vital role in the online transaction process, which is the realisation of value, and hence are seen as an important pillar of ecommerce.
